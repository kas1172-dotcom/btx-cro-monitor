"""Account fit scoring.

Deterministic, rule-based match of a potential account against the client
profile: which of the client's capabilities map to the account, plus its
named customers/programs and geographic focus. No LLM, no network - so the map
is reproducible and auditable in git, like the rest of the engine.

Generic: reads only ClientProfile (client specifics live in config), never any
hard-coded industry term.
