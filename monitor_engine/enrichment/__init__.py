"""Cross-API enrichment: look entities up in third-party APIs and attach the
results as structured facts. Generic - all API specifics come from client config.

Public surface:
    Connector            - executes a ConnectorSpec for a single query
    facts_from_records   - maps API records to EnrichmentFact objects
    enrich_items         - pipeline stage: enriches a list of AnalyzedItem
    build_entity_graph   - links items sharing entities (graph edges + index)
